MicroPython is a Python implementation that compiles and runs 
standalone on a micro-controller.
This makes micro-controller programming even easier than 
using an Arduino.

I will show how to use Thonny to install MicroPython on 
an RP2040 (Pi Pico) board and to program it to run a standalone
application that blinks a single LED and moves a servo motor.
