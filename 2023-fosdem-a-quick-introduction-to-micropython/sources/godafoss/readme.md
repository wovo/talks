This is Python source of the Godafoss library module. 
When used in source format, it must be be copied to
/lib/godafoss, and the  \_\_init\_\_.py 
will be imported by the module mechanism
when godafoss is imported in the application.

The other files are loaded by that __init__.py file, 
either directly, or indirectly, or on-demand,
and provide the (public) features of Godafoss libray.
