talks:
- verbose writing style
- compilation takes temporay RAM depending on file size (?) -> split
- also because transfer takes time
- not all parts are needed -> trampolines (46 bytes?)
- pre-compile speeds up loading
- freezing frees up RAM (run from flash)
- spi-ram is SLOOOW
- I2C is slow (contrast SD1306)
- hardware SPI can be much faster than software SPI (and I2C)
- use a fast & large RAM target for development (teensy 4.1)
- watch out where the latest version of your code is!

- use powered hub for eg. displays, or watch current consumption

- wish list: const for class objects

- effect of @native??

- thonny: I can't get used to upload/download direction
